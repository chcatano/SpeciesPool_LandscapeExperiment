Name of variable,Variable type,Description 
CAREER_betapart_dbrda_2018_2022,,Compositional variation explained by soil resource gradient across all plots in a treatment
year,integer,Year plant composition was sampled
Pool,categorical,Species pool treatment: 2 levels (Low diveristy and High diversity)
Seed.density,continuous,Immigration treatment (seeds added per m2)
tot_dbra_r2,continuous,% Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in plant composition across plots explained by soil resources (R2 from distance-based redudancy analysis)
gra_dbra_r2,continuous,% dissimilarity in plant composition due to abundance gradients explained by soil resources (R2 from distance-based redudancy analysis); Bray -Curtis dissimilarity is partitioned into balanced variation in abundance and abundance gradients
bal_dbra_r2,continuous,% dissimilarity in plant composition due to balanced variation in abundance explained by soil resources (R2 from distance-based redudancy analysis); Bray -Curtis dissimilarity is partitioned into balanced variation in abundance and abundance gradients

CAREER_betapart_1x1_2018_2022,,"Alpha and Beta diversity calculated from plant composition sampled across sites, plots, and years"
year,integer,Year plant composition was sampled
site,unique,site name: 12 sites with treatmetns and plots nested within
plot,character,Plot number: corresponds to unique plots sampled within each site
Pool,categorical,Species pool treatment: 2 levels (Low diveristy and High diversity)
Seed.density,continuous,Immigration treatment (seeds added per m2)
alpha.hill1,continuous,Plant species diversity in each 1m2 plot. Corresponds to the Diversity Hill numeber 1 (exp(Shannon entropy))
beta.tot,continuous,Plant beta diveristy across 1m2 in each treatment. Calculated as the mean distance to centroid using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
